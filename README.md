## What you will learn
- Swapping elements in arrays

- Bubble Sort: 
  - 
  
- Selection Sort: 
  - Using another method to sort it - Create the code for this method, there are other ways to do it 
  but you should learn this method first.
  
- Custom Comparitors
  - How to start? Try to figure out the different cases of comparing two cards and how to handle them (Same suite & different value, different suite & different value, etc)
