# Intro-Sorting-Swift-Playground

## What you will learn
- Swapping elements in arrays
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- How merge sort works

## Common issues
- Swapping: 
  - Same Value in both cards - Remember that if you change a value of the array you loose the previous one, you have to store that value.

- Bubble Sort:
  - Comparing only one time. Remember you need to go trough the array several times to get all the cards into their right position. If you run it only one time only one card is going to get into the correct postion.
  - Going through the whole array everytime to compare. Remember that once you put a card in its right position you dont need to compare it again.
  
- Selection Sort: 
  - Using another method to sort it - Create the code for this method, there are other ways to do it 
  but you should learn this method first.
  
- Custom Comparitors
  - How to start? Try to figure out the different cases of comparing two cards and how to handle them (Same suite & different value, different suite & different value, etc)
  

## What you should understand when finished
- Swapping values.
- How bubble sort works.
- How selection sort works.
- Difference between bubble and selection sort.
- How merge sort works.
